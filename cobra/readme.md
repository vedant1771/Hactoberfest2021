Steps to run this code:-

1.Cobra library (go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra) 2.Any code editor of your choice. (I am using VS Code)

-> I recommend to use VS code and install the go extension by Microsoft. This will update the import statement according to the code. If you use a new package, it will import that package on save. If a package is imported and not used, it will remove that package from the import.

If you still havenâ€™t installed the cobra library, you can install it using below command. [go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra]

this is the infamous "Hello, world." example.

And this text you are reading right now is the "doc string" for the whole program. You can also put doc strings underneath classes, class variables, methods and properties. """

class Hello

def main
    print 'Hello, world.'
