Hello everyone!! I am Pratyush and this is a basic Robot learning environment which aims to teach a 2-wheeled bot to self balance on its own by checking random torque values(see robot_env.py in envs section of self balance folder for further explanations) using DQN Algorithm(see bot_practice.py).

To Run Environment:

              1. Install basic libraries like gym , stable_baselines , tensorflow(version 1.15 or less)[note: it won't work with tensorflow 2, and python3.8 or above only support tesorflow 2. So it would be better to use a conda environment with python3.7 or 3.6 for this project]
              
              2.you could check random values of torque using check_randomvalues.py
              
              3. for proper training run bot_practice.py(it would take 8-10 min for training)
              
              4. Trained bot could be tested using learnt_bot.py.
              
              5.for tuning check robot_env.py in envs section of self balance folder
